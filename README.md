# My_Remainder


I often forget things that to be done, after shutting down the system. So I made a python script 
where My_Remainder.py is used to set the remainder 
and 
script.py reminds you the left out work. 

It has TTS to tell you the left out work

I placed script.py in the startup menu of windows so that every time you turn on, script.py remainds you 

To place script.py in startup
C:/ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup

Enjoy !
